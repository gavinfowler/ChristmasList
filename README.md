# Christmas List

This is an application to share christmas lists for friends and families.

## Motivation

This project was inspired by me wanting to learn more about Flask and Vue.js.

## Code Style

- Server side formatting was done with Black
- Client side formatting was done with prettier (see `client/prettierrc` for more info)

## To Initialize DB

WARNING: when doing this, go into the .flaskenv file and change the `DB_SETUP` variable to 1. Once finished, change it back to 0.

```sh

## To Upgrade DB

Whenever you change any of the models, these commands need to be run:

flask db upgrade
```
